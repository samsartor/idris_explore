LANGUAGE EXPLORE PROJECT
========================
Names: Sumner & Sam

Idris is a purely functional programming language with dependent types.
Dependent types are powerful enough to encode mathematical proofs in the type
system, thus if the code compiles, the proof is correct.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

On Arch Linux, install the "idris" package.

Compilation Instructions
------------------------

Run "idris <filename> --check" to ensure that the program compiles. If it does,
then the proof contained in <filename> is correct.

What We Proved
--------------

- even.idr
    - defines a function which tels whether or not a number is even
    - proves that for all natural numbers k, 2 * k is even
- math_worksheet.idr
    -
